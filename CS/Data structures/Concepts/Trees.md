Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Binary Tree Representation
A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node (commonly known as the “root”) of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts:
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child
