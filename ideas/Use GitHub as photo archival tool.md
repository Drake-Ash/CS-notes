GitHub enforces 100gb per repo and 50mb file limit. Good idea for making use of it as photo archival

1. Album/Albums level repo
2. Photos will be encrypted with passwords
3. Videos will be cut down into smaller files with lossless compression and encrypted
4. CSV stores metadata about files
5. Client will handle syncing based on file watch properties
6. Client will do lazy loading of displaying content and cache it in file system after decrypting

Good to haves
1. Push to multiple sources -> GitHub, bitbucket, gitlab
2. One album to multiple repos (cases where album size larger than repo)
